# SNHU-CS-330-Final

How do I approach designing software?
I was cautious to approach this designing software. I've used Visual Studio before, but I've never made graphics though. I have learn a lot about OpenGL and I would love to keep working with it on my own time. I think I would rework my entire design process and start new because this project was curse from the beginning because of outside forces. I would like to start over and follow the LearnOpenGL website from start to finish and see if I could get a better feel for it than what I gained from the SNHU provided tutorials.

How do I approach developing programs?
If I were to do this again I would change my approach. I would start more with more of the basic shapes, add the movement of the camera, add the light then add the textures and the end while making the tweeks to make it look even better. I would change the order in which I would do things because I feel like I was worrying about to many things at once. I would want to break it all down and focus on one aspect at a time.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
My goal is to get into the Computer Information Security field, however I would love to have a back ground knowledge in computer graphics. Computer science in general would be a great way to get ahead in the IT field because if I find I'm not as interested in something as I thought I would be I could always change and go after web development or app development, or computer graphics. I know I would like to learn more about computer graphics and possible make my own detailed 3D scenes or even a game.
